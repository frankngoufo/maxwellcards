# WHAT IS PHPVISA
PHPVISA is a very lightweight PHP framework designed by Cedric Che-Azeh. This tool is designed for developers working on API-based projects with [blogvisa](https://blogvisa.com), but it is made available for public use under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Release Information
This repo contains in-development code for future releases. To download the latest release, query the branches and checkout to the branch carrying information for the latest version

## Server Requirements
PHPVISA works with PHP 8.0 or newer.

It could very well still work with PHP 7.3 or newer, but this is not recommended.

## Licensing
PHPVISA is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Purpose
PHPVISA was built primarily for *control*. It does not purport to be a better alternative to any other existing frameworks. What makes it similar to popular PHP frameworks is its high level of abstraction, modularity and lose coupling. It's however different from them in its extremely light-weight nature.

With PHPVISA, your overall coding experience won't be extremely shortened, but you would be able to have control over much of the code base which constitutes your applications, while maintaining a good level of modularity throughout. You'd have to be versed with object-oriented PHP to use PHPVISA

## Installation
Installing PHPVISA is as easy as cloning it from its [github repository](https://github.com/che-azeh/phpvisa.git).
